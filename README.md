# lfs-install
This is made for my own personal use but if you wish to use it as well then feel free. Just do understand everything that is running in the script before using it because it is doing stuff that can wipe your entire system. I have intended this installation script to be used on a LIVE distro. Specifically Arch based but you can still use it with any distribution. This is all fresh so plenty of work needs to be done for it to run properly.

A bunch of scripts built to automate the process of installing Linux from Scratch.
